# @tnotesjs/ssg

The additive, Vite-powered static-site generator for TNotes knowledge bases. It
owns only the pieces TNotes consumes: Markdown-to-Vue compilation, filesystem
routes, static rendering, dead-link validation, local search, preview and a
small responsive shell. It has no VitePress runtime dependency.

```ts
// tnotes.config.mts
import { defineConfig } from "@tnotesjs/ssg";

export default defineConfig({
  base: "/my-kb/",
  title: "my-kb",
});
```

```sh
tnotes-ssg build
tnotes-ssg dev
tnotes-ssg preview
```

Supported compatibility boundaries are covered by fixtures: Markdown with Vue
SFC blocks and components, literal `{{ }}` in prose (not live interpolations),
base paths, dead-link checks, local search, math, containers, shared Shiki code
blocks and static HTML output.

Markdown notes are documents. `{{` / `}}` in the body, inline code, and raw HTML
are encoded so Vue's template compiler leaves them alone — the same characters
show in Desk, GitHub, and the published site. Interactive values belong in a
sibling `.vue` file or a component prop (`:text="message"`), not in `{{ n }}`
written into the Markdown.
